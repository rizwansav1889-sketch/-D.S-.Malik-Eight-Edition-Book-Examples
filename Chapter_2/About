This folder contains the example programs and the solutions to Exercises 9–23 
from Chapter 2 of “C++ Programming by D.S. Malik (8th Edition)”.
This section of the repository focuses on the foundational elements of the 
C++ language, and the examples here help new learners understand how to apply 
the concepts practically. The examples demonstrate key topics such as variable 
declaration, initialization, basic arithmetic operations, increment and 
decrement operators, simple expressions, and the use of input/output streams. 
They also show how to use data types effectively, apply type casting when needed,
and work with named constants and strings.

Exercises 9 to 23 provide hands-on practice of all the essential Chapter 2 concepts. 
These exercises reinforce how variables behave when their values change, how arithmetic 
operators follow precedence rules, and how mixed expressions are evaluated when integers
and floating-point numbers are combined. Students also practice reading input using 
cin, writing output using cout, and understanding operator behavior such as %, +=, -=, 
and other compound assignments. A few problems focus on converting between data types,
formatting output, and applying escape sequences correctly.

Together, the examples and exercises strengthen your understanding of the core building
blocks of C++. By completing this section, beginners will be able to write clean, basic 
programs, perform calculations, handle user input, apply operators correctly, and build 
confidence before moving on to more advanced chapters.
