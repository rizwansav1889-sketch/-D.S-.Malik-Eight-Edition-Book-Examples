Chapter 3 of “C++ Programming by D.S. Malik (8th Edition)” focuses on understanding
how data is handled through input and output streams in C++. 
This chapter goes beyond the basic use of cin and cout by introducing more advanced
stream functions and formatting tools that help control how data is read, displayed, 
and processed. You learn how characters can be inspected, skipped, or returned to the 
input stream using functions like get, ignore, peek, and putback, which are essential 
for tasks such as validating user input or reading structured text.
The chapter explains how input errors occur and how they affect the state of the stream. 
It shows how to detect invalid data, clear error flags, and restore the input stream so 
the program can continue functioning normally. This introduces beginners to the idea of 
safe and reliable input handling.
A major part of the chapter also focuses on output formatting. Using manipulators such 
as setprecision, fixed, showpoint, setw, and setfill, you learn how to control decimal 
places, justify text, set field widths, and format numeric values neatly. 
These tools help create user-friendly and professional-looking console output.
Finally, the chapter introduces file processing, explaining how to read from and write
to files using ifstream and ofstream. It covers opening files, closing files, and using 
stream operations with file objects. This chapter builds the foundation for structured 
input/output and prepares students for more complex programming tasks ahead.
