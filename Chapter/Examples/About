Chapter 4 of “C++ Programming by D.S. Malik (8th Edition)” explains how programs 
make decisions and change the normal flow of execution using control structures. 
This chapter focuses on selection statements, which allow the program to choose 
different actions depending on conditions. You begin by learning about relational
operators and how comparisons are performed using the computer’s internal 
character ordering. These comparisons form the basis of logical expressions, 
which evaluate to either true or false.

The chapter introduces one-way and two-way selection structures using the if and
if…else statements. You learn how conditions control program behavior, and how 
improper use of semicolons or misplaced syntax can lead to logical or semantic 
errors. The concept of pairing else with the nearest unmatched if is explained 
to help avoid common beginner mistakes.

Logical operators such as !, &&, and || are introduced to build more complex 
conditions. You also learn how blocks { } group multiple statements into a single 
unit within a selection structure. The chapter shows how input stream states can 
be evaluated directly in conditions, making programs more robust and error-aware.

Finally, the chapter covers multiway selection using the switch statement and how
break is used to control its execution flow. The use of assert is also introduced 
to terminate a program when unexpected conditions occur. Overall, this chapter 
builds a strong understanding of decision-making in C++ programs.
